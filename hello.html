But times have changed: Users and designers are accustomed to systems with statistical components and behaviors. What does it mean for the formal methods community?In this tutorial, we will discuss how such a dramatic change in the acceptance and design of systems presents exciting opportunities to make fundamental contributions: we need to rethink the notions and techniques for the design of specifications and verification methodologies. In particular, we will focus on the systems whose behaviors are not naturally captured by symbolic relations but rather require reliance on probability distributions. We will discuss our recent efforts in designing formal methodologies for testing whether a sampling subroutine generates a desired distribution. We will showcase the challenges, opportunities, and rewards in our journey</span></p></span>
